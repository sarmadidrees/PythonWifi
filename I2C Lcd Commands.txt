Basic tutorial for I2C lcd with Pi
Main Link: http://www.circuitbasics.com/raspberry-pi-i2c-lcd-set-up-and-programming/

Connection:
Mostly lcd are powered with 5V supply but unfortunately, Pi supports 3v3 GPIO.

Attach lcd's Vcc to 5V supply on Pi.
Attach I2C lines to the relevant pins 

BUT

Just to be safe, you MUST remove the Pull-Up resistors on the I2C line in the LCD I2C module.

otherwise,

Pi will Pull Up the lines to 3.3 and the LCD Module will be trying to pull up to 5V
